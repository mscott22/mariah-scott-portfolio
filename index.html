       <h2>About</h2>
  <p>My name is Mariah. I am a junior at Eastern Washington University. I am majoring in visual communicatin design. My favorite thing in the world to do is travel. I recently just went to France and am hoping to visit Spain over the summer. When I'm not at work or school, I like to cook, workout and hang out with my friends and family.
